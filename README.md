## Running Inferno Across America  - Readme

This document provides a step-by-step guide on how to locally run our React project built with Next.js. Make sure you have the necessary software installed before proceeding.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure that you have the following software installed on your system:

1. **Node.js**: Next.js requires Node.js to run. Download and install it from the official [Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/).

2. **npm** (Node Package Manager): npm comes with Node.js installation. It's used to manage dependencies and packages. You can update npm by running `npm install -g npm`.

### Getting Started

Follow these steps to run the React project using Next.js:

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone the project repository to your local machine using Git. Open your terminal and run:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Tjorne71/cdv-project.git
    ```

2. **Navigate to Project Directory**: Use the `cd` command to move into the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd cdv-project
    ```

3. **Install Dependencies**: Install the project dependencies using npm. Run the following command in your terminal:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

4. **Run the Development Server**: Once the dependencies are installed, you can start the development server. Run:

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

    This command will compile the project and start a local development server. Open your browser and visit `http://localhost:3000` to see your project in action.

5. **Stopping the Development Server**: To stop the development server, press `Ctrl + C` or `control + C` in your terminal.

### Additional Commands

Here are some additional commands you might find useful:

- `npm run build`: Builds the production-ready version of the project.
- `npm start`: Starts the production server after you've built the project.

### Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues during the installation or running process, please refer to the official Next.js documentation or seek help on relevant forums.

### Conclusion

Congratulations! You've successfully set up and runned our React project using Next.js.
